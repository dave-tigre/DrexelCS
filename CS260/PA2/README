If any of these files are missing please let me know.

Notes:
1) Having some issues with the Makefile. It is only running the first
program on the target list. Not sure if this is something with the way I
created it or an issue with my computer. When the files are run
individually, they all work properly.

2) For timing the trees:
	Preorder traversal was done as modeled from the books preorder traversal
(page 83).
	I could not however figure out a correct form of post order traversal
method in time for submission. The book did not have an example that I could
find, after a few trials, I was not able to create a working method.
	
3) For merge list, it works for the most part, however for the beginning of
some lists, it does not sort some numbers correctly. Same for the list
concatenate.I think it has something to do with how I have my INSERT
method.
