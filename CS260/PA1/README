Submission files contains:
- arraylist.py
- arraystack.py
- pointerlist.py
- pointerstack.py
- timing.py
- timing.pdf
- Makefile

If any of these files are missing please let me know.

Notes:
All test code is in the respective implementation file.

pointerlist:
	had some trouble with the delete function. several if statements were
placed in order to adjust and make code work, not as clean as I would have
liked though.

timing:
	used the timer function to time function execution. result is in seconds
so  multiplied by 1000 to get milliseconds.
