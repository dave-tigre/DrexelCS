CS265 Section003 Assignment3

Run:
To run the files, just compile using javac and run the Chase.class file
which contains the main method. The outcome of each event will be displayed
and the statistics will follow.

Notes:
The assignment stated that a single random generator was supposed to be used
for the entire program, however, since the Cat and Mouse constructors needed
a generator for the input, I had to create another one in the Chase class. I
did not figure out another way around that aside from creating the second
generator.
