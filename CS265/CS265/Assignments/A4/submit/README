RUN:
Should be able to just run the make file and execute the program. Was not
sure if you wanted it to run from the makefile, but I decided against it.
To run the program you must type './CDDB'

NOTES:
1. How you wanted us to add the tracklist wasn't specific so I made it so
that it accepted a name for a track everytime you hit enter, unless you type
'0' which it reads as you being done with track names.

2. Was unsure on how I should implement a temporary file, so that is not in
place.
