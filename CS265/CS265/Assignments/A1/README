README

Instructions:

- Run as a bash with either one or no  arguments
- Go through directories and view the dir.xml files

Notes:

- For some reason, even though I have an if statement identifying
  directories, it only populates the <dir></dir> in the xml file with the
current directory, for any subdirectory where the xml file is created, it
places the directories in the <file></file>  section of the xml. After
trouble shooting, I was unable to find a solution.
