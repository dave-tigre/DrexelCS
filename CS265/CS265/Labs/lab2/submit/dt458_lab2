corrections

Q7:
the diff command shows the difference that is found between the same line
numbers of the 2 files

Q8:
There was no output because there are no differences since it is comparing
it against the same file.

Q9:
The difference in the return values reflects the type of error that occurs
when the command is entered. The 0 return value meant that no error
occurred. The 1 return value meant that it did not find the word in the
file. The 2 return value meant that a more serious error existed since the
file doesn't exist.
