Part1:
1.1:
It had a "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" error. A new file called "core"
was created.

1.2:
The function that it bombed was the "inTable()" function because of an error
with  __strcmp_sse2_unaligned ().

1.3:
a) The problem was the scanf() function, it expected an address of the variable
it is writing to and not the actual variable. I replaced the "n" in the
function with a "&n"

b) The problem was that the specifiers used for the "pi" and "n" were wrong.
The "pi" value needed the "%f" specifier and the "n" needed the "%d"
specifier.

c) The problem was that the numLines was being incremented before the array
used it in line 49. To fix this, I moved the "++numLines" after the
assingment for the array so that it could be assigned as the incrementation
occured properly.  

d) The scanf() function expected an address to write to, similar to bug1.c.
It was fixed by replacing "n" with "&n".

e) Problem is that it returns an array with an empty first element.

1.4:
The compiler can't catch this because it only catches syntax errors.

1.5:
If the inputs are specified by the type then the compiler will catch the
error.
