1.1
The choice of names are not descriptive, not sure what EOF is supposed to
mean. There is also not-eof which is inconsistent with how EOF was is
originally spelled.

1.2
int smaller(char *i, char *j) {
	if(strcmp(s, t) < 1)
		return 1;
	else 
		return 0;

1.3
This excercise was just to read code out loud

1.4
a) if ( c != 'y' || c != 'Y')
		return;

b) if (length < BUFSIZE)
		return length;
	else
		return BUFSIZE;
c) if (flag = flag)
		return 0;
	else
		return 1;
d) if (quote == (*line == '"')
		return 1;
	else
		return 0;
e)	val = 1 ? 1:0

1.5
'&val' and '&ch' are both using the read function, but the input parameters
for the read function is a pointer *

2 1
2 2

1.7
a)	if (!istty(stdin) && !istty(stdout) && !istty(stderr)):
		return(0);
b) return(retval)
c) for(k = 0; k < 5; k++)
	scanf(%lf', &dx);
	x += dx;

1.8
for (count = 0, count<total, count++) {
	if (this.getName(count) == nametable.userName()) {
		return (true);
	} 
}

1.9
Multiple evaluations cause performance issues and could even cause an
out-right error.

1.10
enum{
	FTZMETER = 0.3048
	METERZFT = 3.28084
	MIZFT = 5280.0
	MIZKM = 1.609344
	SQMIZSQKM = 2.589988
};

1.11
a) the function is void, so will not have a return value
b) comment not necessary, modulus is commonly used to test for even numbers
c) comment should only be a brief description of the function, the function
itself is self-explanitory and comments about the incremenation are
unnecessary
